# Nizzelayout as ZMK config

This layout assumes that the [EurKEY keyboard layout](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/layout.html) is used in the operating system. Regular characters, like a-z, 0-9 and the most commonly used symbols, will work with a US layout as well, but some characters, like å, ä & ö, won't.
